# FEEDBACK LINEARIZATION BASED CONTROL OF NON-LINEAR SYSTEMS WITH UNKNOWN DISTURBANCES
Non-linearity is an inevitable part of the majority of the systems we come across. In
general, a non-linear system controller is a type of control system that is designed to
regulate the behaviour of a non-linear system. Non-linear systems are complex and often
exhibit unpredictable behaviour, making them difficult to control using traditional linear
control methods.

To address this challenge, non-linear system controllers use advanced algorithms and
techniques to model and analyse the system, and to generate appropriate control signals
that can effectively manage its behaviour.

One of the key challenges in designing a non-linear system controller is the need to
accurately model the system's behaviour, including its various non-linearities and
dynamics. This requires the use of advanced mathematical techniques, such as nonlinear system identification and non-linear control theory, to accurately capture the
system's behaviour and to develop appropriate control strategies.

Non-linear system controllers may incorporate advanced techniques such as adaptive
control, robust control, and optimal control, to account for uncertainty and to generate
control signals that are robust to disturbances.

Overall, the design and implementation of a non-linear system controller require. By
effectively addressing the challenges of non-linearity, uncertainty, and disturbance, a nonlinear system controller can help to improve the performance, stability, and reliability of
complex non-linear systems.

A feedback linearization controller and a disturbance observer are combined in this study
to form a robust controller. Despite being subjected to an unknowable external force, this
controller is able to tame the chaotic behaviour of a nonlinear system. To prove that the
suggested strategy works two numerical simulations (Duffingâ€™s Oscillator and Genesio System) are run.
